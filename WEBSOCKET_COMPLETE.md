## 🛠️ **For Your Team's Next Development Phase:**

### **When Building Actual Screens & Features:**

#### 1. **Use WebSocket in Components:**
```jsx
import { useSocket } from '@swarmfill/shared-components';

const OrderTrackingScreen = () => {
  const { trackOrder, on } = useSocket('http://localhost:3000', userInfo);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = on('order_update', (data) => {
      // Update order status in UI
      setOrderStatus(data.status);
    });
    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your tracking screen UI
  );
};
```

#### 2. **Install Socket.IO in Other Apps:**
```bash
# Hub owner app
cd frontend/hubowner-mobile-app && npm install socket.io-client

# Courier app  
cd frontend/courier-mobile-app && npm install socket.io-client

# Admin dashboard
cd frontend/admin-web-dashboard && npm install socket.io-client
```

#### 3. **Integrate Real-Time Features:**
- **Customer App**: Order tracking, courier location on map
- **Hub Owner App**: New order notifications, inventory updates
- **Courier App**: Delivery assignments, location broadcasting
- **Admin Dashboard**: System monitoring, emergency alerts
