## Project Summary

**Problem Statement:**
The project addresses two primary challenges in modern logistics:
1.  **Inefficient Last-Mile Delivery:** Traditional delivery is slow (24-48 hours), expensive, and vulnerable to disruptions from crises or demand spikes.
2.  **Suboptimal Warehouse & Transportation Operations:** Inefficiencies in warehouse picking routes, truck loading, and delivery routes lead to increased operational costs.

**Objectives & Solution:**
The project, now framed as the **"Walmart Community Commerce & Logistics Platform,"** tackles these problems with an integrated, two-part solution:

1.  **SwarmFill Network:** A decentralized, community-driven micro-fulfillment network where local homes and businesses act as AI-curated mini-warehouses ("hubs"). This aims to make delivery significantly faster (15-minute pickup or 2-4 hour delivery) and more resilient.
2.  **SmartLoad AI:** An AI engine designed to optimize the entire logistics workflow, with a focus on hyper-local, personalized inventory management.

The overall goal is to create a system that dramatically cuts delivery costs and times, empowers local communities economically, and builds a supply chain that is deeply integrated with Walmart's existing infrastructure and data.

## Key Innovations

1.  **Hyper-Personalized Hubs:** Instead of just storing popular items, the AI will analyze local buying patterns from nearby Walmart stores to stock hubs with hyper-relevant products. The "Community Curation" feature will suggest a "starter inventory" for new hubs based on local demographics and purchase history.
2.  **"Drive-Thru" Hubs & In-Store Integration:** The platform will introduce new, convenient delivery options. "Drive-Thru" Hubs will allow customers to pick up orders directly from a hub owner's home. The platform will also integrate with Walmart's existing stores, allowing for in-store returns of items purchased from a hub.

## Next Steps

Our current focus is on implementing the "Hyper-Personalized Hubs" and "Drive-Thru" Hubs & In-Store Integration" features. We have already updated the `README.md` to reflect this new vision. The next step is to decide which part of the implementation to tackle first: the backend, the frontend, or the AI model.

## Troubleshooting Docker

We are currently troubleshooting a Docker installation issue. The `docker` command is not being recognized, and we suspect the Docker daemon is not running.

**Last action:** I have advised the user to restart their computer and ensure the Docker Desktop application is running before we proceed.
